/**
 * Basically what I want to test is the execution time of union find algorithms
 * 1. I want to vary the algorithm
 * 2. I want to vary the problem size (ie. the size of items)
 * 3. I want to focus the testing efforts to a specific method (e.g. union or connected)
 * 
 * The performance tests should take care of executing the performance test case
 * It should execute the method a desired amount of times with non-static parameters
 * It should track the execution times and provide min, max and average of the execution times
 * - the algorithm
